        ## Important
        Please be aware that I am reluctant to implement any feature requests at
        all for this workflow. Reason being that task management is very personal,
        and there are hundreds of different workflows and needs for it, and
        implementing them all will be close to impossible.

        This workflow is focussed on managing tasks due today, and nothing more.
        If you think you have a suggestion for a new feature that fits the spirit
        of this workflow, you can open a feature request. Just be aware that
        it's not unlikely that the suggestion will be rejected.
